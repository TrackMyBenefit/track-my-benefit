## Architecture Design Integration Guidelines

### Design Principles Alignment
**Derived from Business Requirements:**

1. **Scalability First:** Architecture must support 10x growth from initial user base
2. **Security by Design:** Healthcare data requires built-in privacy and security controls
3. **Cost Optimization:** Startup budget necessitates pay-as-you-grow infrastructure model
4. **Rapid Iteration:** 4-month MVP timeline requires simple, deployable architecture
5. **Integration Flexibility:** Multiple third-party APIs require adaptable service layer

### Architecture Validation Criteria
**Success Measures:**

- **Performance Validation:** Load testing confirms sub-2-second response times under expected load
- **Security Validation:** Penetration testing and compliance audit readiness
- **Scalability Validation:** Architecture supports 5K users without major refactoring
- **Integration Validation:** All critical third-party APIs successfully integrated and tested
- **Cost Validation:** Infrastructure costs remain under 15% of total budget through Month 12

### Technical Decision Framework
**Decision Criteria Priority:**

1. **MVP Timeline Impact:** Does this choice accelerate or delay 4-month delivery?
2. **Budget Impact:** What are the upfront and ongoing costs relative to budget constraints?
3. **Scalability Impact:** Will this choice support growth to 5K users and 100 businesses?
4. **Team Capability:** Can current team implement and maintain this technology choice?
5. **Integration Compatibility:** Does this enable required third-party service integrations?
