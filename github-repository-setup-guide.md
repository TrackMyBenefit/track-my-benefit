# GitHub Repository Setup Guide - Track My Benefit

## Quick Start - Import Issues to GitHub

### Option 1: Bulk Import via GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
brew install gh

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Navigate to your repository directory
cd /path/to/track-my-benefit

# Import issues from JSON file
gh issue import github-issues-import.json
```

### Option 2: Manual Import via GitHub Web Interface
1. Open your GitHub repository in browser
2. Navigate to **Issues** tab
3. Click **New Issue** for each issue in `github-issues-breakdown.md`
4. Copy/paste the title, labels, and description for each issue
5. Set appropriate milestone and assignees

### Option 3: GitHub API Bulk Import (Advanced)
```bash
# Script to import issues via GitHub API
#!/bin/bash
REPO_OWNER="TrackMyBenefit"
REPO_NAME="track-my-benefit"
GITHUB_TOKEN="your_personal_access_token"

# Read JSON file and create issues
cat github-issues-import.json | jq -c '.[]' | while read issue; do
  curl -X POST \
    -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
    https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/issues \
    -d "$issue"
  sleep 1  # Rate limiting
done
```

## Project Management Integration

### GitHub Projects Setup
1. **Navigate to Projects tab** in your repository
2. **Create new project** named "Track My Benefit MVP Development"
3. **Set up project views:**
   - **Sprint Board:** Organize by milestone with columns (Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done)
   - **Epic Overview:** Group issues by epic label for high-level tracking
   - **Team Assignment:** Filter by assignee for individual workload management

### Project Board Columns Configuration
```
Backlog -> Ready for Development -> In Progress -> Code Review -> Testing -> Done
```

**Column Automation Rules:**
- **Ready for Development:** Issues with all dependencies resolved
- **In Progress:** Issues assigned to team member with active development
- **Code Review:** Pull request created and linked to issue
- **Testing:** Code merged, ready for QA validation
- **Done:** All acceptance criteria validated and issue closed

---

## Development Workflow Integration

### Branch Strategy
```bash
# Main branch protection
main (production-ready code, requires PR review)
├── develop (integration branch for sprint work)
├── feature/auth-system (individual feature development)
├── feature/insurance-integration
├── feature/family-management
└── hotfix/security-patch (urgent production fixes)
```

### Issue-to-Code Workflow
1. **Issue Creation:** Use templates from `github-issues-breakdown.md`
2. **Branch Creation:** `git checkout -b feature/issue-123-user-registration`
3. **Development:** Regular commits referencing issue number
4. **Pull Request:** Link to issue, include acceptance criteria checklist
5. **Code Review:** Team member review with acceptance criteria validation
6. **Merge & Deploy:** Automated deployment pipeline with issue auto-close

### Commit Message Convention
```bash
feat(auth): implement OAuth 2.0 social registration (#123)
fix(insurance): resolve API rate limiting issue (#145)  
docs(readme): update setup instructions (#167)
test(family): add unit tests for permission system (#134)
